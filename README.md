### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French Web Developer with a **very curious mind**. I love learning and trying new things but I also love digging through subjects like **accessibility**.
I've worked at Access42 as an **Accessibility trainer and consultant for 4 years** and I am now focusing on **front-end development**.

I recently spent 6 months learning about **NodeJS and ReactJS** with [O'Clock.io](https://oclock.io/), at the end of which I worked on the [Cod'Access Project](https://github.com/florian-sanders/cod-access). I am currently working at [Tediber](https://tediber.com/) as a front-end developer with **VueJS and NuxtJS**.

#### Things I've learned lately
* TypeScript,
* VueJS,
* NuxtJS,
* Laravel.

#### Things I'm Learning
I'm always searching for new things to learn. Here is a short list of what is on my radar at the moment:
* Web Components and lit framework,
* Storybook,
* Test Driven Development (practice),
* Symfony & API Platform,
* ...
