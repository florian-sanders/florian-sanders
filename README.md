### Hi there 👋

I'm a French Web Developer with a **very curious mind**. I love learning and trying new things but I also love digging through subjects like **accessibility**.
I've worked at Access42 as an **Accessibility trainer and consultant for 4 years** and I am now focusing on **front-end development**.

I recently spent 6 months learning about **NodeJS and ReactJS** with [O'Clock.io](https://oclock.io/), at the end of which I worked on the [Cod'Access Project](https://github.com/florian-sanders/cod-access). I am currently working at [Tediber](https://tediber.com/) as a front-end developer with **VueJS and NuxtJS**.

#### Things I've learned lately
* TypeScript,
* VueJS,
* NuxtJS,
* Laravel.

#### Things I'm Learning
I'm always searching for new things to learn. Here is a short list of what is on my radar at the moment:
* Web Components and Lit framework,
* Storybook,
* Test Driven Development (practice),
* Symfony & API Platform,

#### Things I want to learn later
* Rust,
* GoLang,
* Flutter.

💙 💚 ❤️

Other than that I love TV shows 📺, music 🎧, video-games 🎮, animals 😻 and kind people ❤️
