### Hi there 👋

I'm a French Web Developer with a **very curious mind**. I love learning and trying new things but I also love digging through subjects like **accessibility**.
I've worked at Access42 as an **Accessibility trainer and consultant** and I am now focusing on **front-end development**.

I am currently working at [Clever Cloud](https://github.com/CleverCloud/), mostly on the [clever-components Project](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-components) as a front-end developer with **Web Components using Lit**.

I like to spend time tweaking my [Nixos Config](https://github.com/florian-sanders-cc/dotfiles), testing Desktop Environments, code editors, etc.

💙 💚 ❤️

Other than that I love TV shows 📺, music 🎧, video-games 🎮, animals 😻 and kind people ❤️
