### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French Web Developer with a **very curious mind**. I love learning and trying new things but I also love digging through subjects like **accessibility**.
I've worked at Access42 as an **Accessibility trainer and consultant for 4 years** and I am now searching for a **place to start a new adventure**.

I recently spent 6 months learning about **NodeJS and ReactJS** with O'Clock.io, at the end of which I worked on Cod'Access Project.
